## Binary trees 
In computer science, a binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.
In this project I learned about binary trees and put my knowledge into practice by implementing algorithms like insertion, deletion, and traversal methods such as inorder, preorder, and postorder traversal.
